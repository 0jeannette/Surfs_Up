Surfs_Up Challenge 

Overview

After traveling to Hawaii, I decide that I want to move there and open a surf and snack shop business. One of my potential investors has suggested that I do some analyses of local weather patterns, specifically precipitation patterns since frequent rain will lessen the chances of the business’s success. The investor specifically requested temperature data for the months of June and December to determine if the surf shop business is sustainable year-round.

Results

The average temperatures for June and December ranged in the lower to mid-70’s with hardly any fluctuation in average temperature between the two months.

The maximum temperatures were both in the mid-80’s for June and December which demonstrated a consistency in high temperature patterns. 

The minimum temperature of 56 degrees for December showed the greatest difference compared to June’s minimum temperature of 64 degrees and may signal to my investors that December is not conducive to doing business with ice cream or surfing. 

Summary

The weather patterns in June and December were very similar as well as their average temperatures and high temperatures. The average low temperatures varied with December having a much lower average temperature than June. Additional queries would include summary statistics of temperatures recorded by station to help determine where to build the prospective shop in Hawaii as well as obtaining data to measure quantities of rain in targeted areas between June and December.
